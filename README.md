Hello ! This is the DNA software made by Arsalan Ghassemi for the Problem Set 6 of CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course.

The user should input the command python dna.py file.csv file.txt with the csv file as the database of people to look in and the txt file as the DNA sequence to analyze.

The software then returns the owner of the DNA by checking the Short Tandem Repeats in the DNA sequence.
